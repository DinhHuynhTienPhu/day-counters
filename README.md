Hello, this is a small project for HCMUS students to count days since Hao, our beloved friend joined the military service.

Hosted at: https://go-cay-soi.netlify.app

To contribute to this project, please fork this and then create pull request.

Or you can contact me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/phus1011/

Please keep the code as simple as possible, don't add too much libs or  fancy things. I tend to keep the website as clean as I can.

TODOs: 
**- important: have a dedicated back-end, this current API is shit. Limited only 10ks requests**
- Has all the links related to Hao on this website. (if he like).
- Has a page to explain who is Hao and why does he get so much love from us. => created but need some contribution
- Has a page called weekly recap so that Hao can visit every weeks, and know about recent news. (should be related to HCMUS, game industry, and things he care about) => changed to "Notes" page, people can leaves up to 3 notes a day. (TODO: has daily notes, weekly notes, all time notes)
